# ðŸš€ Flexible React Input Component

## Project Overview

This project showcases a highly **flexible and customizable React input component** (`InputField`) built with **Tailwind CSS**. It's designed to provide a robust and aesthetically pleasing input solution for various web applications, demonstrating best practices in component design, state management, and responsive styling. The accompanying `App` component serves as a comprehensive demo, allowing users to interactively explore different variants, states, and features, including a **dark/light mode toggle**.

## Key Features

The `InputField` component offers a wide range of features to cover diverse UI/UX requirements:

- **Comprehensive Input States:**
  - **Disabled:** Clearly indicates when an input is not editable.
  - **Invalid:** Provides visual feedback for validation errors with distinct styling.
  - **Loading:** Displays a subtle spinner for asynchronous operations.
- **Visual Variants:**
  - **Outlined:** A classic input style with a visible border.
  - **Filled:** Features a background fill for a more pronounced look.
  - **Ghost:** A minimalist, transparent design that becomes prominent on focus.
- **Adaptable Sizing:** Supports `sm` (small), `md` (medium), and `lg` (large) sizes, adjusting padding and font for different contexts.
- **Informative Text:** Includes options for:
  - `label`: Clearly describes the input's purpose.
  - `placeholder`: Provides a hint for expected input.
  - `helperText`: Offers supplementary information or guidance.
  - `errorMessage`: Displays specific error messages for invalid states.
- **Optional Enhancements:**
  - **Clear Button:** An intuitive 'X' icon appears when text is present, allowing users to quickly clear the input.
  - **Password Toggle:** For password fields, an eye icon allows users to show or hide the entered password for convenience.
- **Theme Support:** Seamlessly integrates with **light and dark modes** using Tailwind CSS's `dark:` variants, controllable via a dedicated toggle button.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures optimal display and usability across various screen sizes and devices.
